# Project_2_SF
Full stack development from cleaning data to Flask app, to front-end web design and data visualization

In this project, I will be building a website using the business registration data in San Francisco since 1886. There are more than 250,000 rows of data in the dataset, and it includes information like business's location, date of business opened in that location, category of the business, neighborhood, and etc. See the link of the dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis

Part I. Data Preparation

Due to some technical issues with PostgreSQL, I have only loaded around 8000 rows of data into the database. I will go back to complete that when I finish building the web.

Part II. Web Design

In the homepage, there short paragraph tells the purpose of the website.
Then there is a filter for users to look for the businesses they are interetsed in. The dropdown meno in the upper right corner can navigate through other visualizations. 

Visualization 1. Bar chart

This bar chart has a filter function, which allows the data to be filtered down by category of business and/or year start in the location.


Visualization 2. GeoMap

The map has three views: light, night, and geo. 
It shows the location of business in San Francisco by category.
